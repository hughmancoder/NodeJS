# NODE ABOUT

node.js
- runs js outside browser environment
- used to build backend services such as APIs
- power web apps and mobile apps which may talk to back-end services
- uses google's V8 engine to run javaScript on computer
- we don't have browser environment features like window and document

# Benifits

- easy to get started and good for agile development and prototyping 
- JS good for full stack
- JS is everywhere (front / backend)
- cleaner and more consistent code base
- large ecosystem of open source libraries

# runtime environment

- node is not a programming language
- JS engine in every browser
- engine may lead to different behaviour in different browser

 - Asyncronouse architecture
    - requests can be run simultaneously
    - thread allocated to handle request on server
    - new requests have to wait for threads

# uses

- should not be used for CPU intensive applications
- good for reading/writing data. Data intensive and realtime applications
